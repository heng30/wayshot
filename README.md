### Introduction
This is a screen recording tool for `Linux` `Wayland`, which uses the `wlroots` extension protocol to capture screenshots. Commonly used desktop environments include `Sway` and `Hyprland`. It is based on `Rust` and the `Slint` GUI framework.

### Features
- Single screen recording
- Single input device audio recording
- Desktop audio recording

### How to build?
- Install`Rust`, `Cargo`, `libpipewire` and `libalsa`
- Run `make desktop-debug` to run it on desktop platform
- Run `make desktop-build-release` to build a release version desktop application
- Refer to [Makefile](./Makefile) for more information

### Troubleshooting
- Using the `Qt backend` can resolve the issue of fuzzy fonts on the Windows platform. It is also recommended to prioritize the `Qt backend` to maintain a consistent build environment with the developers.
- `ffmpeg` needs to be installed. It is used to combine the recorded video and audio into the final `MP4` file.
